# Task 3
Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs. 

Dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data.


## Problem Statement:
A company wants to classify images of cats and dogs. The company has a dataset of images of cats and dogs. The company wants to use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify the images.

## Results :
- The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used to classify the images of cats and dogs.
- The accuracy of the model on the test set is 60% due to the small size of the dataset used.


## What i learned:
- How to use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm from the scikit-learn library.



**To run the the model in browser:**

1. install first streamlit :  `pip install streamlit`
2. to run it : `streamlit run .\index.py`
