# Task 2 : Create a k-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

## Problem Statement:
A retail store has a dataset of customers with their purchase history. The store wants to group the customers into different clusters based on their purchase history. The store wants to use the KMeans algorithm to group the customers. The store wants to know the optimal number of clusters to group the customers.

## Results : 
- The optimal number of clusters is 5.
- The customers are grouped into 5 clusters based on their purchase history.


## What i learned:
- How to use the KMeans algorithm from the scikit-learn library
- How to use the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters
- How to visualize the clusters using a scatter plot
